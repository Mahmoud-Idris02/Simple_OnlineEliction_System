Election Voting System
This is a simple election voting system built with Python and Tkinter. The system allows users to vote for two candidates and displays the winner and percentage of votes.

#Getting Started
To run the election voting system, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer. You can download Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have installed Python 3, you can download or clone this repository to your local machine.

#Usage
To use the election voting system, open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the files are saved. Then, run the following command:

Copy code
python election_voting_system.py
This will launch the system's graphical user interface (GUI).

To vote, enter your election ID and select your preferred candidate. Once you have voted, the system will remove your ID from the list of eligible voters to prevent multiple votes.

When all eligible voters have cast their vote, the system will display the winner and percentage of votes.

This system was built as a project for learning Python and Tkinter.
